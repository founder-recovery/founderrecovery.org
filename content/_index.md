*Founder Recovery* provides an organized affinity network to support former founders as they decelerate.  For now, this comes in the form of monthly dinners in ðŸ—½ NYC, giving former founders a confidential space to refine what might come next.

## You

This group may be for you if all of these are true:

 1. You previously founded a company
 1. You might want to found a company again
 1. You're in the ðŸ—½ NYC metropolitan area (or willing/able to travel)

Itâ€™s possible that former founders now working at "regular" jobs and those at negative growth companies could be interested as well.

See the [about](/about) page for more details.

## Us

We provide a monthly forum in the form of a dinner.  Currently, this is invite-only and attendees pay up front for the cost of the dinner (this may be sponsored at some point in the future).
