*Founder Recovery* provides an organized affinity network to support former founders as they decelerate, reintegrate themselves into their lives, re-prioritize what's important to them, and decide what's next. For now, this comes in the form of moderated bi-monthly dinners in ðŸ—½ NYC, giving former founders a confidential space to refine what might come next.

## You

This group may be for you if all of these are true:

 1. You previously founded a company, even if you now work somewhere else (though you're not _currently_ a founder)
 1. You might want to found a company again
 1. You're in the ðŸ—½ NYC metropolitan area (or willing/able to travel)

Itâ€™s possible that former founders now working at "regular" jobs and those at negative growth companies could be interested as well.

See the [about](/about) page for more details.

## Us

We provide a bi-monthly moderated forum in the form of a dinner. This is an invite-only event and we ask that you fill out a short form to help us ensure that all participants fit with our mission for the events. The more detail and richness you can provide in the form, the easier it will be for us to match participants with each other and create the most robust conversation possible.
